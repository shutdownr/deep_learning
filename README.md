# deep_learning
This project aims at building a convolutional neural network from scratch in C++. This is mainly thought of as an exercise for myself to be able to fine tune the inner workings of neural networks in an isolated setting on a low-level basis, rather than using python and its libraries. I am currently working on this as a side-project.
